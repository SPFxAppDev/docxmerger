# @spfxappdev/docxmerger

This is a merge/copy of the [docx-merger package](https://github.com/apurvaojas/docx-merger). But since the package has not been updated for more than 7 years and the package has some bugs regarding "corrupt" Word files, I created my own package. This package also has TypeScript support.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @spfxappdev/docxmerger
```
